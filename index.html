          <h2>About the project</h2>
          <p>The Timeless project is an alternative collection of already existing articles. For Timeless we selected some intresting articles related to two classic topics, like the "Art of Food and Cooking, and "Tech & Science". But the main mission of this project is not only to offer an aggregator of trivial information, but mostly to create an environment that can bring to the surface some of the alternative, additional, and hidden aspect of those texts. Moreover, one of the main purpose of the Timeless project is to offer a pleasant interface that allows the user to experience the act of reading displaying the proposed articles in different artistic styles inspired by historical past and future event and periods. We like to think about Timeless as a time machine that give us the possibility to experience an aesthetic journey into the history of typography and design, that give us the possibilty to enjoy a flight through centuries, while suspended in space and time.</p>
          <p>The main objective of Timeless is not to replace the original position of these articles but it is simply an experiment, developed for or the final examination of the course of Information modelling and web technologies held by Fabio Vitali within the Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge of the University of Bologna. In fact, all the original locations of the articles presented on Timeless are indicated both in the actual display of the articles and in the desclaimer in the navigation bar. The idea behind Timeless is to create a framework that can contain articles and issues without limits, to which you can easily apply different typographic themes and discover additional metadata and information, capable of enriching the reading experience and thus creating the MMMM (Metadata Model for Modern Magazines) model required. For the moment Timeless offers only a limited selection of articles and issues, chosen by the team that created this project. The articles present were chosen according to the personal interests of the team and with the aim of providing a basis on which to develop the different possible stylistic views. To learn more about the choices made regarding the styles, see the documentation dedicated to each historical period.</p>

          <h3>1910 - Art Nouveau</h3>
          <p>Art Nouveau was an artistic-philosophical movement that was born in France between the end of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth century and spread throughout Europe, with different names in different countries: in Italy, for for example, Art Nouveau was known as "Liberty Style". The historical period of Art Nouveau coincides with what is remembered as the "Belle Époque". Art nouveau was a style that spread easily and influenced the visual arts, architecture and applied arts. From a visual point of view, the works of Art Nouveau are characterized by an accentuated decorative elegance and gentle and sinuous lines that meet and intertwine harmoniously. Art Nouveau was born as a reaction to the industrial production of mass-produced objects made possible by the automation processes of the late nineteenth century. To escape the standardization of the product, the Art Nouveau artists innovated it, embellished it with a personal touch to make it unique. Despite this criticism of mass industrial production, Art Nouveau artists were the first ever to lend their work to the creation of advertising posters and posters that are now considered true works of art. Some of the major artists of this movement were: Aubrey Beardsley, Gustav Klimt, Alphonse Mucha, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Eugene Grasset, Jules Chéret, Georges de Feure, Antoni Gaudí, and several others.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The Art Nouveau style was clearly a style capable of giving all-round expressive freedom. Precisely for this reason, it is difficult to delineate stylistic boundaries within which to include all the creative works produced. A selection was made for the purpose of this project; in fact, starting from the magazine area, an iconic magazine of those years was selected as a reference for the stylist choices made in the graphic line of the project. Likewise, among all the illustrators available, one, in particular, has been selected to represent the category with his style on this site. The reference magazine for Timeless is, therefore, the "Jugend" magazine and the artist is Alphonse Mucha.</p>
          <p>Jugend magazine was a rather long-lived German magazine that also went through several artistic periods. The Jugendstil, the German Art Nouveau style, took its name from the magazine Jugend, which indicates how the magazine has been significant for art, literature and especially the lifestyle freed from the conventions that Jugend advocated: aesthetics, nature, nudism were proposed to a society that at that time still wore the corset and that was bound by many social conventions. From this magazine, with reference to the images taken as a sample, it was inspired by colours, spacing, the arrangement of the text in columns and fonts. The key elements that we can grasp from the images taken as models are undoubtedly the almost total breakdown of the available space, the crib of decorations (floral or otherwise) and advertising. The font chosen for this project, taken from the reference images, is Eckmann, inspired by Otto Eckmann, one of the prominent members of the Jugenstill stile, as well as a graphic collaborator of the magazine Jugend. The Eckmann font is certainly not one of the simplest fonts to read but particularly decorated and complicated fonts were a distinctive symbol of the Art Nouveau style. As well as the presence of vividly coloured illustrations and advertisements. Given the massive presence of these elements, frequent in the pages of Jugend's volumes, the artist Alphonse Mucha and the style of his illustrations were selected to enrich the visualization of the articles on Timeless. In fact, he was a collaborator of the magazine itself, and it is possible to find several covers and illustrations published by him on Jugend. The images taken as a sample were used to capture the style and to create a palette that is as consistent with the style as possible. Besides, the reproduction of an illustration by Mucha was added to the display of the article on Timeless to give the same sensation of advertising in the margin of the page that could be had by reading a real issue of the magazine.</p>
